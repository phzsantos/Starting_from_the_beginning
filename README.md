# Starting from the beginning

This repository is about a course that I did to learn the basics of algorithms and logic programming.  

**Things that I learned:**

* The basic difference between compiled, interpreted and hybrid languages.
* Procedural programming
* Conditional structure
* Loops
* Arrays

**Languages that I learned the basics:**

* Portugol (Pseudo Code from Brazil)
* C 
* C++
* Java
* C#
* Python

## Was worth it?

Hell yes! If you're a Brazilian like me and want to have a solid foundation on coding, you must have it.
